    """
    MicasaVerde Vera control entry point.
    
    This is the class you will use to make the connection to your Vera unit.
    I have designed this system to be dynamic. It builds the code necessary to 
    control any device/plugin that you can attach/add to the Vera. It builds
    the code based on information gotten from your Vera. This package is 
    roughly 3000 lines of code but will generate thousands more. The amount 
    generated is based on what is installed on your Vera.
     
    When the connection to your vera is first established it will automatically
    generate all code form all available information gotten from your Vera. 
    Some of the code files will not necessarily be used but will be available 
    in the event you install a device that needs them. As far as plugins are 
    concerned if the code necessary to interact with that plugin has not been 
    generated it will be upon discovery of the plugin.
      
    This library uses upnp to attempt discovery of your Vera in the event it is
    unable to you will need to pass the IP address of the unit to this class. 
    The upnp process does take a while to acquire the IP address. The Vera does
    not respond very quickly to a upnp discovery packet. My suggestion is to 
    pass the constructor the IP address.
    
    When the code files are built they are stored in the following locations. 
    Microsoft Windows: %APPDATA%\Micasaverde_Vera
    Linux:             ~/.MicasaVerde_Vera
    
    In the event you have some kind of an issue. I am going to need a copy of 
    the files located in the coorsponding folder above. Do not worry there is 
    no sensitive data stored in these files. I am also going to need a copy of 
    the traceback.
    
    OK so now onto the good stuff.
    
    from micasaverde_vera import Vera
    
    auto discover ip address:
        instance = Vera()
    provide the ip address:
        instance = Vera('192.168.0.0')
    
    
    to discover the Vera and return it's ip address (This is only available 
    before you construct the instance):
        ip_address = Vera.discover()
    
    
    to refresh the generated code files:
        Vera.build_files('192.168.0.0')
        
    You do not have to build the files directly. When you construct the 
    instance it is automatically done if the files do not exist. The files 
    will only be built once (as long as they still exist) so the first time of 
    running this library it will take a while to first load. Upwards of 45 
    seconds on a vera that only has a handful of devices and a plugin or 2.
    
    The whole system is designed to give you access to everything you can do 
    from the UI and more. It exposes all of the variables for all of the 
    different devices/plugins as well as the Vera unit it's self. The variables
    you are allowed to change you can change. I have also exposed any functions
    that are available for devices/plugins. Things like toggling state 
    refreshing the Z-Wave network, polling a specific device, upgrading a 
    plugin. Since this is a dynamic system I am unable to give you a list of 
    what you can and cannot do. So your best bet is to all dir() in a specific
    part of the API. I have modifiec the output of dir() so it will return what
    is available for that specific component. Typiclally functions will be 
    lowercase and any attributes/properties will be camel case. If an attribute
    cannot be set you will get an AttributeError.
    
    to get a device you can use one of the following:
        device = vera.get_device(10)
        device = vera.get_device('10')
        device = vera.get_device('Some Device Name')
        
    if you want to list off all of the device names and device numbers that 
    are attached to the Vera:
        for device in vera.devices:
            print '#{0}   {1}'.format(device.id, device.name)
            
    if you want to change the device name:
        device = vera.get_device('Some Device')
        device.name = 'New Device Name'
        
    There are cases when an attribute will have an illegal character and cannot
    be called directly. One use case is with the Weather Underground plugin.
    It uses variable names like Forecast.0.HighTemperature. In this example you
    would use:
        device.Forecast0HighTemperature
    
    I know of only '.'being used thus far but just in case I made the system 
    in such a way that in the event there are other characters used you can 
    still gain access to the variable by use of getattr():
        getattr(device, 'Forecast.0.HighTemperature')
        
    The same mechanism used for the devices works for the following:
        vera.categories:
            vera.get_category(category name or category number)
        vera.sections**:
            vera.get_section(section name or section number)
        vera.users:
            vera.get_user(user name or user number)
        vera.rooms:
            vera.get_room(room name or room number)
        vera.scenes:
            vera.get_scene(scene name or scene number)
        vera.installed_plugins:
            vera.get_plugin(plugin name or plugin number)
        vera.user_geofences:
            vera.get_geofences(user name or user number)
            
    The following containers are special use containers:
        vera.ip_requests
        vera.upnp_devices
        vera.alerts
        vera.user_settings
        vera.weather_settings
        
    **Sections are used when multiple vera units are joined together. 
    This is where the id and name of the controller are stored
    
    Remember dir() is your friend for showing you what is available. Reading
    the generated code files will be of little help because not everything that
    is in those files will be available for your specific device.

        Automatic updating
        Events for changes
        Creating/Altering Scenes (testing)
