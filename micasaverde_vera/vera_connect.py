    Connection handler
    
    I have a connection handler to the Vera so that way it manages the flow of
    information to and from the Vera as not to overload it. I am still 
    tinkering with how many connections the Vera can handle at one time. 
    I think I am going to have to make it so that it dynamically changes the 
    number based on response time. This is because the load on the Vera is not
    going to be the same on a per user basis.
